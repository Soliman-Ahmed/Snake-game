# Snake Game in C
Introduction
Welcome to the repository for a classic implementation of the Snake game, written entirely in C. The game is a simple, console-based application, which makes it a great tool for beginners learning C or game development.

Game Rules
In this game, the player controls a snake which grows in length as it eats fruit that randomly appears in the play area. The game ends when the snake runs into the game area boundary or into itself.

Features
The game is text-based and runs on the console.
The snake is controlled using w-s-d-a keys.
The game keeps track of the score, which increases as the snake eats more fruit.
